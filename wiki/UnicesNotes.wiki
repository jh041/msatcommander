#summary Unix-like OS-specific Notes and Details

== Running the GUI ==

Provided that you are using a unix-like operating system (FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, &c), you should be able to run the GUI source with
{{{
python msatCommandGui.py
}}} 
*or* 
{{{
pythonw msatCommandGui.py
}}} 
depending on your python installation and environment.  However, there are several dependencies:

  * Python (2.4.3 and 2.4.4 known to work; 2.5.x status unknown)
  * [http://www.wxpython.org/ wxPython] (version 2.6.xx)
  * [http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page Biopython] (CVS versions after 2/26/07 should work)

Biopython may be checked out of anonymous CVS (password: cvs):
{{{
cvs -d:pserver:cvs@cvs.open-bio.org:/home/repository/biopython login
cvs -d:pserver:cvs@cvs.open-bio.org:/home/repository/biopython co biopython
}}}

If you don't want to fuss with the CVS version of Biopython (you still need the stable 1.42 version), you should checkout msatcommander from one of the tagged subversion directories (< version 0.4.5).  To checkout the code, you must have the subversion client installed.  Then:

{{{
svn checkout http://msatcommander.googlecode.com/svn/tags/msatcommand-GUI-0.4.4/ msatcommander-svn
}}}

Earlier tagged releases (< 0.4.5) use the Fasta module that is available in Biopython 1.42.  Newer versions make use of the SeqIO modules which are faster and *handle exceptions better* than the older Fasta modules.

Biopython should implement these new features with the 1.43 release.

== Command-line version ==

There is also a command-line version of msatcommander (msatCommand.py).  This is currently available from the trunk svn directory:

{{{
svn checkout http://msatcommander.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ msatcommander
}}}

*However*, I have not gotten around to updating the code - so it is old (version 0.3.0) and *slow*, in comparison to the new code.  

After getting the OSX and WinXP binaries sorted and tested, I will update the command-line version so that it will reflect the current status of the code.
