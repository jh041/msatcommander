#summary Unix-like OSs Specific Notes and Details

== Running the GUI ==

Provided that you are using a unix-like operating system (FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, &c), you should be able to run the GUI source (msatCommandGui.py) with
{{{
python msatCommandGui.py
}}} 
*or* 
{{{
pythonw msatCommandGui.py
}}} 
depending on your python installation and environment.  However, there are several dependencies:

  * Python (2.4.3 and 2.4.4 known to work; 2.5.x status unknown)
  * [http://www.wxpython.org/ wxPython] (version 2.6.xx)
  * [http://biopython.org/wiki/Download biopython 1.43] (*MUST* be 1.43 or a current CVS snapshot)

== Command-line version ==

There is also a command-line version of msatcommander (msatCommand.py).  This is currently available from the trunk svn directory:

{{{
svn checkout http://msatcommander.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ msatcommander
}}}

The commandline code has been (mostly) updated to a version equivalent with the GUI versions.  You can only scan for 'All' microsatellite classes at the moment.  This will be fixed shortly.  You may run the code with:

{{{
python msatCommand.py -i infile.fsa -o outfile.csv -s All
}}}

As above, there are several dependencies:

  * Python (2.4.3 and 2.4.4 known to work; 2.5.x status unknown)
  * [http://biopython.org/wiki/Download Biopython 1.43] (*MUST* be 1.43 or a current CVS snapshot)

== Using biopython from CVS ==

As of 3/17/2007, this is not neccessary as the needed changes are in the [http://biopython.org/wiki/Download biopython 1.43 release].  However, if you want the bleeding edge, here are instructions for checking it out:

Biopython may be checked out of anonymous CVS (password: cvs):
{{{
cvs -d:pserver:cvs@cvs.open-bio.org:/home/repository/biopython login
cvs -d:pserver:cvs@cvs.open-bio.org:/home/repository/biopython co biopython
}}}

You will then need to install these files as you would any other module for python:

{{{
% python setup.py install
}}}
