#summary Unix-like OSs Specific Notes and Details

=Getting The Source=
The source code is available from the Downloads section as a tarball.  To unzip,untar, run:

{{{
tar -xzvf msatcommander-<version>.tar.gz
}}}

You can also check out the source from the trunk using subversion.  

{{{
svn checkout http://msatcommander.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ msatcommander
}}}

=Getting primer3_core=
Prior to runnning msatcommander, you will need to locate or build a [http://primer3.sourceforge.net binary version of primer3] (1.1.1 or greater).  

To build the primer3 binary:
  # Download the most recent primer3 source (http://primer3.sourceforge.net)
  # Unzip and untar the download (`tar -xzvf primer3-<version>.tar.gz`)
  # cd to the src directory
  # run: `make all`
  # cd to the test directory (`cd ../test/`)
  # run: `perl p3test.pl` (runs regression tests on the binary)


The `primer3_core` binary should then be copied to the top-level of the directory created from the msatcommander tarball or the directory checked out from the trunk using subversion.

== Additional dependencies==

  * Python (2.5.x known to work)
  * [http://www.wxpython.org/ wxPython] (version 2.8.xx)
  * [http://biopython.org/wiki/Download Biopython] > 1.50

==Running the GUI==

Provided that you are using a unix-like operating system (FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, &c), you should be able to run the GUI source (msatcommander.py) with
{{{
python msatcommander.py
}}} 
*or* 
{{{
pythonw msatcommander.py
}}} 
depending on your python installation and environment.

= Command-line version =

There is also a command-line version of msatcommander (msatCommand.py).  This version ONLY locates microsatellite repeats, and the new repeat-finding code within this module will be integrated to the GUI version at some point in the near future.  Additionally, the msat-finding code is implemented as a set of classes that can be applied to custom/more general problem.  msatCommand.py is currently available from the trunk svn directory:

{{{
svn checkout http://msatcommander.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/commandline/ msatcommander
}}}

Calling msatCommand.py without any arguments will display the help.

{{{
python msatCommand.py
}}}

As above, there are several dependencies:

  * Python (2.5.x known to work)
  * [http://biopython.org/wiki/Download Biopython] > 1.50
