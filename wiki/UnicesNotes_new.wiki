= Getting the source =

You can check out the source from the trunk using subversion

`svn checkout http://msatcommander.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ msatcommander`

You can also check the code out from github (main development area):

`git clone git://github.com/brantfaircloth/msatcommander.git`


= Dependencies =

Before running the code, you will likely need to install the following libraries.  The versions I use to build the OSX application are given in {x.y.z}.  Some of these packages (e.g. pysqlite) may not be necessary.  I've included them because I needed them to build a proper application bundle with Py2app.  YMMV:

 * [http://qt.nokia.com/downloads The Qt libraries] for your distribution {4.6.3}
 * [http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/download SIP] {4.10.2}
 * [http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download PyQt] {4.7.3}
 * [http://biopython.org/wiki/Download biopython] {1.54]
 * [http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/PySqlite pysqlite2] {2.6.0}
