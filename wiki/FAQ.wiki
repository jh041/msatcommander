==Does msatCommander work in OS X 10.3?==
 In the soon-to-be release 0.4.4, msatcommander works in OS X 10.3.9

==Will msatCommander work with Chromas files?==
 This should be fixed in the 0.4.4 version.

==Is msatCommander a universal binary?==
 Yes, it is!  *But*, you will have to download the 0.4.3 version from the [http://gallus.forestry.uga.edu/software/msatcommander/ binary downloads] link.  It is *not* the featured download on the front page due to current restrictions on binary file size by google code.  

 Even without the universal binary and under rosetta (emulation) on a new imac (2.16 Core Duo Deuce), msatCommander still runs approximately 2X faster than my office machine (a lowly MDD G4).

==Why the Beachball?==
 You will notice that (at least in the osx version of msatCommander) you get the beachball while the program is searching for repeats.  This is *normal*.  

 At some point (not a priority) I will use python threads to get rid of the beachball.  I will also implement a progress bar.
