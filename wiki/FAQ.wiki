==Does msatCommander work in OS X 10.3?==
 In > 0.4.4, msatcommander works in OS X 10.3.9

==Will msatCommander work with Chromas files?==
 In > 0.4.4, Chromas files should work.

==Is msatCommander a universal binary?==
 Yes.

==Why the Beachball?==
 You will notice that (at least in the osx version of msatCommander) you get the beachball while the program is searching for repeats.  This is *normal*.  

 At some point (not a priority) I will use python threads to get rid of the beachball.  I will also implement a progress bar.  For now (0.4.5 and above), a popup window indicates completion.

== What is performance like? ==

 _Pretty good_.  Here are some examples:

  * Scanning a single ~80,000 bp sequence from _Didelphis virgniana_ for all repeats took roughly 28 seconds on a pentium 4 @ 3 ghz.

  *  Scanning 10,000 reptile contigs (approximately 16% of the entire genome) for tetra-nucleotide repeats took roughly 2 hours on a pentium D @ 3.4 ghz.  Six-thousand, one hundred twenty-four sequences contained repeats; 25,434 repeat arrays were identified (Thanks go to Nick Crawford, Savannah River Ecology Lab, for the information.)

  * Scanning 96 contigs for all microsatellite repeats (mean contig length ~ 400bp) took roughly 33 seconds on a DP 867 mhz G4 powermac.  

  * Scanning the same 96 contigs for all microsatellite repeats from above on a Core Duo 2 Intel iMac @ 2.16 ghz took roughly 16 seconds.

  * GUI and command-line speeds are roughly the same (+/- 0.2 seconds)
