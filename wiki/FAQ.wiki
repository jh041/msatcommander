==Does msatCommander work in OS X 10.3?==
 apparently not at the moment.  i will attempt to fix when i have the time.


==Will msatCommander work with Chromas files?==
 yes and no.  to use chromas files you will currently need to change the file ending to '.txt' from '.fasta'.

==Is msatCommander a universal binary?==
 yes, it is!  *but*, you will have to download the 0.4.3 version from the [http://gallus.forestry.uga.edu/software/msatcommander/ binary downloads] link.  it is *not* the featured download on the front page due to current restrictions on binary file size by google code.  

 even without the universal binary and under rosetta (emulation) on a new imac (2.16 Core Duo Deuce), msatCommander still runs approximately 2X faster than my office machine (a lowly MDD G4).

==Why the Beachball?==
 you will notice that (at least in the osx version of msatCommander) you get the beachball while the program is searching for repeats.  this is *normal*.  

 that being said, i will try and implement a progress bar of sorts to _hopefully_ get rid of the annoying beachball.
