#summary Windows XP Specific Notes and Details

There is now a beta version of a windows executable available (see downloads section).  There are some known issues with this version.  These are:

  * you must unzip the archive somewhere... there is not an installer at this point.
  * ensure you add the '.csv' to the filename in the save-file dialog
